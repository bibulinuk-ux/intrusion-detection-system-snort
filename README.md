Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Lab
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Snort in a controlled local network lab environment. The objective of this project is to monitor network traffic, detect suspicious activities, and analyze potential threats using custom Snort rules.
🎯 Objectives

Install and configure Snort as a Network IDS

Monitor real-time network traffic

Create and test custom Snort rules

Detect basic attack simulations (e.g., ping flood, port scanning)

Analyze log output and alert behavior
